# Test Management NAdapter

This is an analog of adapter written in [Java](https://github.com/teo-rakan/test-management-adapter), 
which gathers basic build information and useful artifacts (titled values, user defined files, screenshoots, stack traces) 
for further processing by Jenkins Test Management plugin.
